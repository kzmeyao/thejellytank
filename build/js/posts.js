If you&#39;ve read that one, you would know that I like to redesign things, <em>a lot</em>. True enough, my site went through a huge face-lift between this post and the last one.

I&#39;ve heard great things about Jekyll and how well it works with hosting on Github, but the creator in me wanted to take on a new challenge. Ultimately, I didn&#39;t need a full-featured system, I wanted to keep everything fairly minimal, I didn&#39;t want to become a hardcore blogger (let&#39;s hope this doesn&#39;t bite me in the future), and I was hell-bent on making it a single page application. Those choices led me to Gulp.</p>\n"}};var posts=[];for(var post in Posts){if(Posts.hasOwnProperty(post)){posts.push(Posts[post]);}};
