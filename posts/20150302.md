Nuts & Bolts

Believe it or not, it has been half an year since my last post. If you've read that one, you would know that I like to redesign things, *a lot*. True enough, my site went through a huge face-lift between this post and the last one. I incorporated some pretty nifty technologies, so I thought I'd take the time to talk about them.

One problem I had to solve early on was to decide whether I should go with a static content generator or whip up something on my own. I've heard great things about Jekyll and how well it works with hosting on Github, but the creator in me wanted to take on a new challenge. Ultimately, I didn't need a full-featured system, I wanted to keep everything fairly minimal, I didn't want to become a hardcore blogger (let's hope this doesn't bite me in the future), and I was hell-bent on making it a single page application. Those choices led me to Gulp.
